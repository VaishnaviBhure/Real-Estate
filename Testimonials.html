With Makaan Instant App, an Android user will be able to experience the ease of Makaan App without actually having to install it on his/her mobile phone. If a user sends a link to property details from Makaan.com’s website to another user, the recipient will be able to access the details even if he/she doesn’t have the app installed. Whereas, without Instant App, tapping on the link would’ve taken the recipient to the web version of the site. A user simply has to go to ‘Settings’, select ‘Google’ and then activate ‘Instant Apps’ from the list. He then has to visit Makaan.com website through Google on his mobile phone and engage in the most seamless property search experience ever, similar to using an app, thus also helping users to save storage space on their phone. Users can also first check the interface of the app by selecting ‘Try-It-Now’ before downloading the app.</div>
